  - Limit use of "long" data type.
  - Fix bug, ensuring that seed value is representable in 32 bits

0.24
  - Use getcwd() instead of $PWD.
  - Use /dev/urandom instead of time() if it exists for the implicit seed
    value if no explicit seed is specified.

0.23
  - Handle '+='.  Now an error.  This is a bit inconsistent with bare '+'
    handling (a warning).  Consider making both either errors or warnings in 
    the future.
  - Move atol() usage to strto*().  Check errno for errors.
  - Weights are treated as unsigned values.  This avoids the foggy semantics
    of negative weights.
  - Seed sources now can supply either signed or unsigned values.  In prior
    releases, on a 32-bit platform, if a seed value was specified as a "large"
    32-bit unsigned value (>LONG_MAX) the atol() call was saturating the value
    to LONG_MAX.  In this release, seed value strings are converted to 64-bit
    unsigned values, and then the lower 32-bits are used.
  - All messages now indicate sknobs as the source.

0.22
  - Handle bare '+' gracefully.  Warn and ignore.

0.21
  - Fix corruption issue when encountering strings > 8KB.

0.20
  - In c, add install dependency on libsknobs.so.
  - Fixed bug in parsing -f args from files if the delimiter flavor is
    set to "crnl".
  - Improve clean target in src/python.

0.19
  - Add new way of tokenizing a string to get knobs.  Search for "token" in
    doc/README for an explanation.  This feature enables whitespace in knob
    string values!  Default behavior is backward compatible.

0.18
  - Default target in src/c/ is now libsknobs.a and libsknobs.so.  To run
    test, use "test" target.
  - Better perl install.  Still installs locally: not to site-packages.
  - Verilog install is just sknobs.sv.  DPI users should point to libsknobs.so.
  - DPI and VPI tests for Questa (see "testquesta_dpi" and "testquesta_vpi" 
    targets.  Haven't touched VCS.
  - VPI sknobs iterate now works on 64-bit platform.  Use vpiHexStrVal to pass
    iterator pointer (sknobsvpi.c).

0.17
  - Remove all generated files from tarball.  Still need distclean target to
  automate this.  
  - Remove random old versions of sknobs.c and patch output from src/c.
  - Python test now works without SKNOBS_HOME set.
  - Tweaks to vcs and questa test targets.  Neither robust.
  - Enhancements to VPI code from Sankalp.

0.16
  - Change to src/c/sknobs.c.
  - Cleaning up error handling.
